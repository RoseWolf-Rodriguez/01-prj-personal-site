        <p>
          Thanks for visiting my first personal website! I am so excited to share a little bit about who I am with the world! I love reading, drawing, and Theology. I have a love for Archaeology, which is what I am studying as an Undergrad at Arizona State University. I am passionate about my family, creative writing, building websites, challenging the norm and learning new skills. This site will grow as I learn more!
